# STM32 FM Radio

Firmware for a portable FM Radio based on an STM32F4 microcontroller some colleagues and I built for a school project. I wrote the driver for the ST7735 LCD display, as well as the GUI.

A demo can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MU_ILlIiBcbePpc5vykY-zbhPCnyO26x/view?usp=sharing).
